I think it was a nice piece of symbolism and a good bookend.

One boy you can't save, and another you do.

It varies from scene to scene. I usually use a lot of pre-made props to populate the scene otherwise it would take a ludicrous amount of time and effort for no reason if I modelled them.

There is Nothing better after a long ass draining exclusion into the Chernobyl NPP, than sitting at the campfire and listening to some songs with comrades. Reflect on all that happened, and pay respect to those we lost. Personally I love “he was a good stalker” and it brings emotions hard. 

You didn’t deserve to die like that Dmitri. Surrounded by monolith, on deaths door, but I had told him to wait outside since I didn’t want him to die. He ignored my order and came in, showed monolith what’s up and went to Slav Valhalla. I lived another day because of your sacrifice and I’ll never forget that. 

Same with metro, these songs bring back stories. Stories about how you and your comrades survived the metro. Same thing as stalker. Time to relax and reflect. 

Check out Campfire stalker on YouTube. You’d love it. Slav Acoustic guitar with gunshots, weather effects, voices, etc. It’s awesome to wind down and reflect to.

There are containers and other common industrial objects everywhere in the game that are very standardized in the real world.

Exodus is a gorgeous game, but there are serious deficiencies with it's attention to realism and plausiblity. These are easy problems to address in the design pipeline. The trick is that you have to actually do them.

I think the game is a net positive on the metro series as a whole. Nothing really was downgraded in any aspect. 

MGR was great and a good idea while in the metro but that concept was a dead end one if we don’t throw realism out the window. There’s no way the rest of Russia would be using MGRs for things, nor would we be able to just walk around finding filters on the ground. The crafting system was good from a logical point of view and a story wise one. 

Just like at the start of Last light, we had the order’s gun smiths which allowed us to pick any gun with any attachment for free. We didn’t pay any MGR for them. being on the aurora isn’t any different than back in D6, Tokarev is our gunsmith that only needs resources to build things for us. Also it would slow the game down a stupid amount by having to wait to find a shop to get upgrades and stuff. A shop that wouldn’t exist in Volga nor taiga. 

There is so much improvement. Minus getting used to the surface levels, the game is still very much Metro with a spin on it to make it drive the story better. We started in a metro and ended in one as well which was pretty cool. ",False,0,t3_auqpyn

metro,environment,1k1d6qk,Metro and spiders,mnn2lg8,"As far as I'm aware of, there are no real life spiders in the Metro games, only the spiderbugs, which come in tiny and big male/big female versions.

Males have long tails and look more scorpion than spider. Females have round butts and look a bit more spider. Though when they're in your face they're somewhat indistinguishable.

Tiny spiderbugs also have pointed tails rather than round butts. Tiny spiderbugs are a lot more creepy-crawly imo.

.

Large spiderbugs appear in certain sections of the map. They're scared of the light, so when the lights go off it's probably spiderbug time.

 You can't really avoid them, but also if you park your butt in a corner and shine your flashlight, they'll mostly dart in, burn, and dart out repeatedly until they die, and the smoke kinda covers them when they're burning which is about as close as you can get to avoiding. You can shoot them to make them die faster, then move on until.

There's also usually only like 1\~2 spider sections per game.

.

Tiny spiderbugs appear kinda everwhere.

Tiny spiderbugs will occasionally be hanging from webs, and sometimes a bunch of them will kinda scuttle out when you loot a corpse or open a locker. Technically avoidable but difficult to fully avoid without knowing where the spiders are beforehand, as you don't see the spidebugs before they scuttle out.

While the webbing spiders appear all over, spiderbugs in corpses or lockers *usually* only appear in places big spiderbugs appear at.

They'll also crawl over your arms/face occasionally. I'm 72% sure this only happens when you walk through webbing or open a spider-filled locker. However, some areas require you walk through webbing to proceed so not fully avoidable.

Though I guess if you just close your eyes for like 3\~4 seconds before walking through webbing or something you can probably avoid them that way?

.

If the male spiderbugs (which is the first image on the wiki) didn't trigger you I don't think the tiny ones will either as they look more or less like the male ones.

The unfortunate part is they always try to attack from behind so your best defense sadly is looking directly at them with your light on to burn them.

As for the filter, yes they have to be changed even sealed because they can develop mold if left open and afther long use they clog. The part which filters particles, usually paper or som fibrous pad from cotton I guess and the active carbon part which absorbs chemicals since active carbon has a tendancy to absorb bad stuff, poisons, medicine and toxins, eventually gets full because it forms an electronc bond to the molecules and when it all is saturated it doesn't wor or if it gets really moist.

metro,environment,1ibiev8,Question about 4A studios and their games,m9io2qb,"Exodus in this regard is a massive case of lucky, and crapshoot. The quality if you really pay attention is kind of all over the place across the board.

Taiga is a level that (reportedly) was reworked dozens of times and 4A still didn't know what to do with it. So they ended up just going with something similar to the Demo (basically a Last light mission, but a bigger map) and called it a day. 

Volga was a map 4A finished fairly early on but just kept spending time ""fine tuning"" the map, and eventually partially reworking things so they could milk Nvidia RTX marketing money.

Caspian its pretty clear that 4A finished that and just never bothered to touch it afterwards. Its the most empty map in Exodus, but at the same time its flow is natural, so its not like its a throwaway map. Its more like 4A just finished it and never bothered to touch it again. Its kind of evident because unlike Volga, or Taiga. In the enhanced edition I encountered a grand total of **0** visual bugs, unlike Taiga, and Volga, where, while it wasn't frequent. I would encounter a good amount of visual bugs, texture or god ray pop in.

Dead City imo is the only map thats a true accomplishment to me. But that might be partially because the level has to most ""on rails"" cutscenes in the entire game, the scripting was probably so heavy, 4A probably couldn't rework anything if they wanted to after they were done. But dead city is by far the most visually impressive. At least until the ticker goes crazy, then good luck seeing anything.

Keep in mind though, This is my opinion from playing Exodus's enhanced edition. And that edition was only made to farm EGS and Nvidia for more money. Its buggy and it plays so much worse then the original. But the game really is stunning when you stop and look around. 

2033/Last light (largely) benefitted from the metro being.... a metro. They didn't have to worry about shitty world lightmaps or global illumination. They worked with a dark sheet of paper, and developed the maps from there. Giving them a lot more freedom of choice in regards to how they wanted to structure the maps.

metro,environment,1ibiev8,Question about 4A studios and their games,maajgj1,"This argument doesn’t really apply to the metro series though.

Now afterwords when they made redux maybe you can argue that they were just milking money, but I feel like despite the bugs redux is a great addition to the series and makes it easier to get into. The only game after that one being the vr game which I have yet to play. The reason why your point doesn’t apply though is because they have only been around for 15 years. A good quality game should take anywhere from 3-7 years. In the time that they have pushed each game, they had done a lot of work in each game. You can’t say they only have a few games so we don’t know if they make amazing games because the few games we have are amazing games and were put out in a really reasonable timing.

In my opinion the storytelling is exactly how it needs to be, dark, atmospheric, slow when Artjom is safe/has important thoughts and talks, fast when it starts to get dangerous. Actually I think it’s written pretty “short” (I don’t know how to say it), I mean the most important messages are told and the intention of the book is clear.

AND YES I love that Artjom is just a normal guy like we are. A weak “kid” that hasn’t seen the world before, no muscles, no extreme intelligence…I love it. 
And lowkey Artjom could be seen as the actual villain of the book (that was my thought at the end of the bonus chapter), because he knew the dark ones are not exactly bad. He just don’t wanted/ couldn’t accept the fact, that they are in fact the only way to save humanity. He pushed it away and ignored it because of selfish reasons. And because of him all hope is lost. In my view, it underlines the egocentric nature of the human.

metro,environment,at23oi,So much wow^^ This game is my GOTY (ingame graphics),egykn64,"I think Metro is a leap in Graphics, not a supergiant leap but a leap nevertheless. I've never been such amazed by environments and details on game, the flags and clothing moving with the wind, the several different type of storms, the lightning... and I just slightly disagree on the RTX barely any effect. I think the technology is good, has a fantastic application in Metro and sets a new standard for lightning in games, however I understand that for a lot of people it will forever the ""is just a little more darker"" kind of meme as the visual representation of light and shadows was not the #1 people valued when talking about engines and graphic fidelity. It's always about texture, res, drawing distance etc. This video however has good insight on RTX and shows scenes where it matters demonstrating the potential for the tech [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiQv32imK2g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiQv32imK2g)

&#x200B;

To me what makes metro so good is the small little details that make the world feel like a living thing and such minor details as the clothes, storms, animals living their way, small bugs for you to squash, dust over objects and surfaces.. it all contributes to the the feeling of not being in a level but in an environment and rarely you see any devs detailing environment this great as 4A. I was actually surprised by Division 2 environment detail when I tried the demo but there is no atmosphere to further enhance that environment whereas metro has it all.

&#x200B;

Besides, when you actually push graphic fidelity to a new level like in my opinion Metro does then people complain because their 1500USD PC can't properly run the game max settings. Which I understand, it sucks that a release you have been waiting for can't be maxed out on your system but there has to be progress and for that to happen systems have to struggle sometimes. Crysis 1 still a meme for a reason, no pc could max out crysis when it came out, yet people were excited and amazed of what could be achieved in the future but put that situation to today's standard and we get 3 pages of forum posts of ""please 4a optimize your shit, I'm not playing until this optimization problems are fixed, 40fps on 1070 is ridiculously"".

&#x200B;

Part of the problem is also because the major publisher have studios who got accustomed to their own engines (dunia, frostbite, void) or public engines like unreal, unity, cryengine and they don't push the games past certain limits they know are ok for enough visual fidelity with not that much of performance consumption. Specially when this games are ported to or from console it helps to have some sort of standard with minor iterations through a whole generation.  I like 4A because they work the old way in that sense ""We are going to try and push our limits to get the most visually stunning graphical advanced game as of now""",True,3,t1_egyht9g

I have been a fan since the first one launched, and took time off work for both Last Light and Exodus' releases (shit, I even built a new computer for Last Light). I'm about as big a fan as of these games as you can get. Exodus is a huge leap for their NPCs, but one of the first things my brother and I commented on was that they still have a distinctly ""metro clunkiness"" to their movement. I have not played RDR2, but I can easily see how another game might have more refined NPC movements. Metro games develop their NPCs better than most, if not all, other games I've played (most games have to spend a lot more time on their NPCs to get the same level of emotional attachment from players....people still talk about Bourbon from the first game and he was with you for literally 2 or 3 levels, depending on how you break up the Dead City), but their movements/animations still have room for improvement.

The Exodus game basically just opens up the world to people who haven't read the book to show them what the world looks like outside and that there are safe spots still. This opens up more possibilities of sequels or spin offs that aren't set in Moscow Metro.

So if you like that aspect Def check it out. They also improve on the stealth mechanics, which is where the game play really shines for me.

metro,environment,1ar3ypk,I Found Metro 2033 to be Underwhelming,kqilf9b,"I think what really bogged it down for me, as someone coming from the books, is that the game is  presented as a shooter (which is understandable for the time/marketing), when it should have been an open world first person survival horror. I think if the player had to worry about food, sleep, disease, etc. It would have made the experience much more accurate to the books. Artyom in the books was not an action hero. He was a boy who starts off somewhat cocky and ends up being humbled time and time again when faced with the horrors and madness of the Metro. Usually thrusted into situations that were beyond his control. 
I'd describe him more as lucky than brave or action oriented. Which is how the games more or less depict him as, a gun toting survivalist badass. Also, I think it would benefit from being even more dark and decrepit. One shouldn't be able to travel through the Metro without a flashlight, and if you do, it's solely to avoid detection. You can partially experience this by turning up the difficulty, but I think it could benefit more from being more environmentally unforgiving. I think this is partially why the mutants aren't as scary as they were in the book, or say in a game like Stalker. There are sections of the game wherein you're supposed to withstand hordes of mutants. I think mowing down 50 mutants en mass sort of takes away from some of their fear factor. Yes, it's intense. But it's not the same as say, you looting a chest after walking through many tunnels of darkness, hearing sounds all around you. Then silence. You think you've evaded whatever was following you, only to be attacked from behind by a Watcher. Others have mentioned the stealth mechanics too, which are more frustrating than anything.

If you don't enjoy the voice work, switch to russian and english subtitles, this game and book wasn't meant for us if not for translations. Saving the metro, having different story outcomes on the decisions you make, almost realistic gunplay considering the developers, these are things you cannot go over and just call the game horrible. 2033 is the oldest game of all of them, play last light, exodus, read the books, and come back with an opinion.

As you said, it really is all about atmosphere... and personally I think the atmosphere is amazing for what it is trying to be

It's a pretty straight forward and short game where you FPS through the remains of a nuclear holocaust, with a decent stealth element thrown in (I always go silencer on my guns and love the throwing knives)

The game is real fun when you just want to run around customizing guns and shooting stuff

I also really like Bourbon and teaming up with him for a bit

The gameplay IMO is similar to Bioshock in many ways... customize weapons, linear levels, FPS with guns, bombs, and melee, the world itself is destroyed by the shittiest of people, you collect journal entries instead of vocal recordings, the mutants remind me a lot of splicers... it's basically Bioshock in burnt out Moscow

The game also in no way communicates that your actions have any consequences at all. i had no idea there were multiple endings for the first 2 games until like 40 min ago and i played the entire trilogy. and the ""different story outcomes"" literally only boils down to the final cutscene, and one of them is not even canon. this game is simply just not that great and i don't think its fair to say that this guy didn't give it a fair chance because he didn't play the other ones or read the book. this is an entry point. you shouldn't have to read a book in order to enjoy it's adaptation. that makes it a bad adaptation imo.

metro,environment,157dw3n,Major lore point in Metro 2034 that no one talks about [ SPOILERS ],jt4ecir,"Well, in the first book, Metro 2033, there is a whole thing when Artyom reaches Polis.

This next part is Spoilers for the book if you haven’t read it yet so tread lightly!!!

But it talks about how Artyom finds a book and reads about how the Soviets aa early as WW1 made pacts and deals with demons and the devil to be unstoppable in combat. How they drew pentagram stars on their armor and tanks to assist them, and how giving the demons blood solidified their contract with them. Furthermore it talks about how the Stars on the Kremlin were made for these demons as well, and just staring at them will put you into a trance.

I love how it is discussed that these things existed before the war. Even in the game Metro Last Light, it is talked about how the Dark Ones existed before the war itself and were all in hiding in a lockup underground.

Then there is also random talks about how in St Petersberg, the Metro tunnels have giant hatches that separate the Train tunnels from the Metro Stations, cause something prowls the tunnels and steals people away.

I mean it's in the fucking name, and if you listen to the dev diaries after finishing the game they where actually planning a bigger level in Moscow and the tunnels, but decided to drop it. I mean the whole point of it is being in the fucking METRO. If they had kept the level it could have seriously saved it for me but instead you spent most of the time outside and in empty places just so they could have an open world game. I found so many places with potential in the game where there was just nothing to do, no notes, nothing. It discourages exploring. If your gonna do that just keep a linear game instead of doing whatever the fuck exodus is. Imo it doesn't do either one right, it should just pick a lane (linear or open world) and stick to that. Doing this whole weird semi linear in an open world just doesn't work. Also the whole economy system is bullshit, just give me back traders and bullets. We lost so many cool weapons with this new system and non of it makes sense.

metro,resource,1dr20r8,The Resource Disappearing Problem in Exodus,lxhlso9,"I know I'm late to the party but I'm replaying the enhanced edition on pc with duelsense controller.  My question is, what's so bad about the autosave  mechanic? It saves quite a bit which is a nice feature to have instead of having to save on your own. I was just curious ",True,1,t1_lat4y3q
metro,resource,1dr20r8,The Resource Disappearing Problem in Exodus,lxhk9z5,I agree there are rage inducing moments but I didn't think it was as bad as you are saying. Wasn't THAT freaking bad. But I do agree they could have done some things a little better. But a lot of pep liked this game. Including me.. i dunno. Opinionsvary i guess.  P.s. yea I know this is an old post but I'm replaying it on enhanced edition on pc with duelsense controller. Plus these posts stay up for research and reply. Just thought I'd throw my few cents in there.,True,1,t1_lbhai3t
metro,resource,1dr20r8,The Resource Disappearing Problem in Exodus,lxj0rul,"1. The autosave is inconsistent. Sometimes you get three autosaves in a row and get stuck in some place or situation you'd rather avoid. For example, you want to stealth a human section. Every time you get spotted you get an autosave. Eventually all three saves get overwritten and you can't go back to the beginning of that section. Bugs/glitches can soft-lock you, and keep in mind that reloading chapters takes ages, courtesy of unskippable dialogue. 

  
2. At other times, you don't get an autosave for 20-60 minutes, die to fall damage or a headshot and lose all your progress. I have wasted hours in this game redoing stealth, exploration and scavenging, especially in Sam's Story DLC. You can force autosaves by sleeping at safehouses, which works perfectly in Volga, but is too time-consuming to do in Caspian due to how few and far between the beds are.

  
3. You can't have several save slots active at the same time. I have to manually put backups in a folder on my PC to archive important sections, usually for stealth testing but also in case NG+ breaks and I need easy access to the finale.  
  
4. There's no quicksaving on Ranger Hardcore, which exacerbates all these issues.

If you like the autosave mechanic, then that's great! I just find that it brings out the worst of my completionism/perfectionism. You don't feel like you are in control of saving, because it's obviously automatic, and that's less of an issue in Redux where the levels are much shorter. If you want to play Red Square in Last Light then you simply pick that chapter. You can't do the same for the Tugboat mission or Baron's Fortress.",True,2,t1_lxhlso9

I felt in love with everything about the two Metro games, and was a little bit skeptical of Exodus and it's open world prospects. I was elated with how the game went though. I think that I did every single thing you can do in Exodus on my first playthrough, l loved the game that much. The Two Colonels, to me, was the series' climax, given how well game returns to it's roots once you enter Novosibirsk for the first time as Artyom. It's very depressing, but it's so well delivered, that it hits the mark with no shortcuts. If Artyom and crew only reached Novosibirsk a month earlier, maybe not only the kid, but a whole lot more  people would survive that.

The only thing that is a question mark for me, is the ending. Okay, they reached Baikal, but you would think a lot of people from neighboring reigons would flock to a land in such a good state, which leaves you wondering, did Artyom and co. just walk into the most well organized authoritarian society in post apocalyptic Eurasia.

There are however some guns where it feels like they're not even worthwhile because of how rare the ammo is. For example, pretty much all snipers. The lolife also falls into this trap where there is ammo, but it's just ridiculously inefficient in comparison with the revolver.

Most of the time I just end up with an assault rifle and a shotgun. Because those feel like the most common ammo, and most effective weapon types. A shotgun for close range, an assault rifle for medium range, long range barely even exists. And once I get a gun just like I want it, I don't really want to ditch it, even if it is out of ammo.

An open world that is restricted to the tunnels and the ground above
 So you can traverse from station to station above ground, but it means taking on the wildlife and radiation. Underground is much safer, but means sneaking around your fellow humans. 

Depending on what you do, the game world changes. If you kill more people in the tunnels, stations struggle to defend against the mutants and stations become overrun. Killing mutant infested areas will likewise increase the population of humans. Depending on where you do any of these things, the stations will form different forms of trust with other stations and different means to provide trade. For example, killing hanza patrols between two station will reduce the trade caravans between them, meaning less supplies for both stations and poorer economy. 

That would give a solid reason to think about your actions and the effect of them on the greater world, mimicking the karma system from 2033 on a better scale for the open world.

To be fair the very barebones state Awakening is in compared to prior metro games is telling why they did that.

\-""Spiderbugs"":  Dont fear light at all

\-Stealth and sneak : Fairly buggy and you cant even shoot out / tuirn off light. Like THE core staple of metro : Sneak through the shadows

\-Throwables : Only grenades (no molotov, knives, claymore) and cans. The later of which you cant store

\-The visibility gague: Often a mere suggestion, enemies will spot you when it is off (was interesting with the 3 lights of 2033, but not with the simplified one)

But especiecally from the Arizona shunshine makers: The snap-controls overlap like crazy: Backpack, ammo pouch (in a wierd spot for ammo) 2nd hand to weapon and sometimes medkit all overlap at about where you would enter the ammo grab spot.

That last part is what REALLY hurts awakening As it isnt just once or twice, but nearly all the time. I have stopped counting at about 30 different ""snapping to the wrong spot"" moments in about 9 hours.

metro,resource,1eji85u,How the hell did Exodus get 82 on metacritic? ,lgf8q3o,"Well, I'm gonna take my guess as to why.

Metro exodus is a very good game, and does very well the things it sets out to do. But, the things it sets out to do are the same as what 90% of western single player fps do, and those usually add some more stuff to make them different. Far cry as a comparison came to mind. I don't know much about it, but its another open-world shooter. Its got everything metro exodus does, but also AI companions, co-op, vehicles worth a damn, more upgrade trees... metro exodus is a good shooter, but it also feels a very basic one.

And there is a fair amount of jank tbh. Stuff like:

- characters dialogues getting desynched, and they start talking over one another

- you cannot walk straight down a set of steep stairs (like those on the crane where Anna is on Volga) without losing contact with the ground.

- sprinting around and hitting some small solid object might send you flying into the air.

- when you rescue Anna in the toxic dump, she sounds like she's coughing her guts out, but the animations don't reflect that.

These are little things. Not important things. But, they are also very obvious and speak of a lack of polish. If we're comparing those to western AAA games as you have in the post, these are the kinds of things that never come up. We're used to western devs just not letting such things slip.

* English voice acting is hit or miss and the flow of conversations feel really outdated. There's always this awkward pause in between dialogue and it really doesn't sound natural.
* I don't understand why Artyom is still mute during gameplay when he talks during loading screens. If the goal is to increase player immersion, then why did they make Sam talk constantly even during stealth sections in the DLC? On the contrary, the protagonist not responding at all to any of the characters actually decreases my immersion.
* The open world sections were the weakest part of the game for me. I'm glad the entire game isn't like that because there's a significant difference in quality compared to the classic Metro levels.

A game I don't see mentioned is Days Gone.

I wouldn't say Fallout because Fallout is not only very different in atmosphere but is a type of game with towns and gameplay loops and just very different sense of situation and what you're doing. I think more in terms of Cyberpunk 2077 than Fallout because 2077 you have that feeling of being in immersive world, the entire world is one experience, like metro, instead of contrasts between go to dungeon place then go to safe town place repeat etc.

I wouldn't say Last Of Us as Metro is largely linear and is playing through a story, but the experience is a sense of going at it alone against the world, while Last Of Us is a sense of simply playing through a story, Last of Us is much more of an adventure type of game - I think of it in the sphere of Tomb Raider reboot games or a Resident Evil game (Resident Evil Village however is a lot of like Metro Exodus in ways, you'd bet that Capcom even had been playing a bit too much Metro Exodus lol) Metro series has that nomadic explorer feel which neither Fallout nor Last Of Us really give. I thnk more of Dead Space than Last Of Us. For a gritty immersive first/third person linear game then Dead Space is like Metro in being a lot more focused on the environment

Days Gone is something that goes under a lot of people's radars and is underrated, and I think when it does get mentioned it's overrated and it's really not all that, but it has that sense of being an explorer going through a desolate post apocalyptic world, the game is all built around your motorcycle, which you upgrade and stuff. It's like a more sandboxish American Metro to an extent.

And pretty much everyone has played Subnautica, and if anyone hasn't they simply must, but that's another game that comes to mind. I've played a lot of games, and when I think of Metro I don't think of Fallout or Last Of Us, and don't really think of Days Gone but I do somewhat, what my mind really goes to is Subnautica because the thing that made me play Metro so many times was the experience of going through a world dripping with atmosphere and feeling of going at it alone, being geared-up, being nomadic, being against an amazing beautiful immersive world, and so Metro and Subnautica are tied at the hip in my mind, STALKER and Days Gone are very much same thing but right there, and Cyberpunk 2077 in my mind is simliar sort of experience to Metro of immersive brutal world and full of atmosphere and similar combat etc, and Dead Space is very tied of Metro and Dead Space both being the darkest immersive linear environment-focused atmospheric action games.

But, and this is a weird thing to say, but the game I've been playing the last half a year that gives me a really strong Metro experience is Starsector, which is completely different genre and just something completely different of it's a 2D game you're commanding a huge fleet of spaceships and it's a huge map of hundreds of stars and planets, and you can colonise planets and so on, and then battles against other fleets goes into a battle map so it's sort of like Total War, but the experience of being in a brutal immersive post-apocalyptic world, managing resources, dealing with all sorts of post-apocalyptic factions and cults, gearing-up, being nomadic - even if you create like an empire and have huge fleets you're actually just the fleet that you're moving around and feel independent as a fleet. And a mysterious post-apocalyptic world of you feel isolated when you go to the distant parts of the sector and uncovering long-lost tech from before the big war and you could run out of fuel and end up stranded and so on.

Similarly I got into Starsector after playing Dredge, which Dredge also gives sense of exploration in a dark world and being nomadic and collecting resources and uncovering an environment. If someone loves most of these games then they'd probably like the other ones

STALKER

Days Gone

Subnautica

Cyberpunk 2077

Dead Space

Resident Evil Village

Virgil gives you blueprints to build the teleporter, now I won't question how does a guy who didn't even worked in the teleportation area somehow was able to cobble up a blueprint by remembering what he heard from people who worked there.

You as the player character should not be able to build a functioning teleporter for it would require precision tools and refined raw materials to build it in  the first place. Now I know what you gonna say, but the teleporter only worked once and then broke of course that would had happened since it's a cobbled mess.

so I think OP has a valid point; sleeping in this bed to get that cutscene is fairly hidden and I'm sure many people have watched in disbelief as Damir decides to stay after they carefully freed all the slaves.

I have over 300 hours in Metro Exodus.

Exodus has the highest replayability value because of the open world. After over 300 hours I can still find new details that I overlooked in my previous playthroughs. Like if you go to the edge of the map where no objective takes you, there will always be SOMETHING there, whether it's a corpse to loot or a little cubbyhole with a note that gives you more insight in the events that happened in the area before you arrived. I absolutely love Metro Exodus and after like 5-6 months of not playing it I do a playthrough again, and I always enjoy it.

Metro 2033 and Last Light have a good replayability as well, but because they are linear it's more of re-experiencing the same things every time, so you really gotta like the aspect of the story and how the characters develop throughout it, for example. I always think of it as one long journey that you experience from the eyes of Artyom, like a really good movie that you can rewatch several times. It's the same principle for me, but maybe not for everyone. It's about being good at immersing yourself in the story, and almost ""acting"" like you're Artyom for real, paying attention to all dialogue and acting human rather than rushing through everything and shooting everything that moves.

It's because they're such a straight forward rollercoaster experience that I always found them to be such replayable games. It's not taking on some big daunting task.

Personally I find the Open World aspect to make games less replayable and I find Exodus less replayable, also because Exodus is so much cutscenes and that gets repetitive. When something is just linear going through environments in one way it's more like watching a film again and experiencing it all again and just doing the motions and it's so little cutscenes and so much gameplay.

I'm thinking you play as a protagonist heavily based on the book version of Aleksandra Petrovna ""Sasha"", with the start of the game begining with her and her banished father. That nicely introduces the game mechanic of collecting things from the surface as her father does exactly that until it kills him. Though it wouldn't be a bad idea to make her a little older to be more physically capable. ",True,1,t1_ly87xgx

RAGEGame,environment,bo2so7,RAGE 2 Review Megathread,ench54n,"It's the open world aspect that changes it. I posted this elsewhere, but a linear shooter has a massive advantage where the gameplay loop of ""Go here, kill bad guys, kill boss"" is engaging enough because level design is so important. That's why these games live and die by well designed levels. The story doesnt matter because getting from point A to point B is fun and entertaining. That simple gameplay loop is engaging because the level was designed with that in mind. Nothing else is needed.

Now make that open world. Instead of a deliberately crafted level that engages us while we are ""going here, killing bad guys, and killing a boss"" we have world design as the focus. Suddenly, we have to craft the entire map and world that is used for the game. A gameplay loop of shooting shit becomes less engaging as it stops becoming the focus. That's the trade off with these games, and why a story is important in open world games. If it was a linear FPS game I wouldn't worry about the story, but if we get dropped into this giant world with a bunch of NPCs and characters and settlements, but no lore and story, just the same gameplay loop, it will quickly turn into a chore.

Max out your Sidewinder immediately and use Overdrive every chance you get.  Never save OD; there will be more, and the multiplier is how you earn more feltrite.  You level up fast if you spam OD.  Once you get the first healing perk you are good to go.  The game is too easy.  It plays better on hard and very hard because it  spawns enough enemies to keep your multiplier and health up.  Fight hard until you have to defib, then be careful.  If you are not looking at your defib recharge, the difficulty is too low.

Keep playing.   The development is uneven.   The first few hours are an awkward tech demo, then it finds its gait.  The female voice actor is better and helps cut through the BS dialogue.


Max out your Sidewinder immediately.  It is brutal on level 5, and only on level 5.   Bullets become valuable.  Forget upgrading the rifle and shotgun; they can wait a bit, trust me.


Use Overdrive every chance you get - the multiplier determines how much feltrite drops.  Turn up the difficulty to hard or very hard so the game spawns more enemies.  You will level up much faster.  Do not be ashamed to defib regularly - it is a weapon and part of the combat loop.  Fight hard until you hit the ground, then play it safe.

The process should be, the player has the option of starting in trade towns, talking to hint vendors to appear bounty, gang hide out, and other activity markers on the map. Once completing those activities the markers should disappear again.

If the game is going to be “open world” the map needs to feel new consistently. The linear process of unlocking locations on the map, filling it up with a bunch of dot icons is messy and completely destroys longevity concept.

- The big one for me personally: NewGame+ option or a way to *reset* in-game locations so that enemies respawn and you have to clear them again. It's a good game but I dread the initial slog of having to collect powers and weapons again. Resetting the collectables as well would be good (mostly just datapads, they're great to read while in the environment you find them in so there's a bit of context, adds so much to the world)     

- Allow the player to toggle (on/off) the perks/abilities chosen in each of the three projects (this will be a **must** if we're given just a reset button.   

- Weapon skins are great but scarce, more of these (and I don't mean on the Microtransaction store) would be nice. Skins that change the weapon model would be sweet (i.e turns the AR into the Settler variant etc)   

- Some sort of trophy room/home like we were given at the end of the Scorcher DLC in Rage 1 (Clayton's old place could do)   

- Changeable voices for the Phoenix   

- Either fast travelling doesn't remove you from your vehicle or you can't fast travel to a town in an unstored vehicle (this one cost me a sweet ride)    

- Weird bug I have where vibration doesn't work on the controller until I turn the option on/off in settings (playing on PC with an Xbox Elite controller)   

- Fix the left thumbstick/WASD sensitivity in the map menu, it's infuriatingly fast just now. Unsure if it's tied to framerate yet though.

Vehicles-some areas it felt like it regressed really badly. Actual driving was god awful slow, I don’t know what went wrong with Avalanche as they made Mad Max (2015 game) and the driving there was perfect. 

No real enemies to kill except some bandits every now and then. 

Narrative- Cliche and unremarkable in every way imaginable. It was incredibly short. I will say it added lore that was pretty good, and returned characters were pretty cool. Especially Rage 1’s protagonist. 

Long term prospects- pretty much no support after the the two DLCs were released. One of which wasn’t very good, and bugs still plague the game. Like wtf who just drops it like that. I think splitting development between two companies is what hurt Rage 2 badly.

RAGEGame,environment,cm7g0k,Suggestions for the next Rage game,ew19r0p,"I've personally found the open world of Rage 2 to be a far more enjoyable, even organic, experience over linear fps. While no doubt that linear fps games are fun, i.e. Doom 2016, Rage 2 taps into a niche gameplay loop where the environment and the combat area feel more intertwined. Scaling up a mountain with a monster truck and leaping unto a bandit den from a unintended angle is both fun and breaks up the gameplay that can get monotonous.

Also, I find open world fps are something of a rarity, and Rage scratches that old itch that began when I started playing the infamous S.T.A.L.K.E.R games. I get  what you're proposing, however. It can feel 'empty', and seeking out combat definitely changes how people see a game instead of having a constant, semi-linear flow in which combat is regulated.

As far as “woke”, I didn’t get that vibe at all. Like at all. John Marshall doesn’t seem “woke”. I feel like people look into this a bit too much, like it’s just a game go have some fun, it’s not social commentary lol. 


For vehicles, clunkiness is definitely a valid concern. I didn’t feel that at all when using the handbrake, but the fact that you and many others did is bad design. 

I think the bad reception from this game is that people don’t enjoy going from place to place and killing bitches. Many people I know decided to skip out on nearly every available combat scenario.

When it comes to vehicular combat, you are pretty much shoehorned into using the Phoenix throughout your whole playthrough. The ChazCar is fun for getting around quick and racing, but if you want to take any convoys out the Phoenix is necessary. Almost all the other vehicles you find in the wasteland are either too slow and clunky, the weapons are useless, or they lack weapons altogether. Another problem with them is the lack of upgrades. The Phoenix is the *only* vehicle you can upgrade, and I had it fully upgraded about halfway through my first playthrough.

Use Overdrive every chance you get.  The multiplier determines how many pieces of feltrite enemies drop.  Buy injections and blueprints.  Make a dash to the Overgrown City, i.e. abuse consumables and do the easy missions like supply drops to get the Overdrive perks from Keenan early.


Get 125 health or so and then max out Overdrive with the Cyber Doc before you touch Damage Augmentation.  Overdrive is far more important.  I can keep a string going until everything at the location is dead and walk away with full health, half an OD meter and loads of feltrite, on Nightmare.


Increase the difficulty so you face more enemies - it’s easier because of the feltrite healing and Overdrive chains, and you’ll level up faster.

I strongly feel the hint vendors should be offering bounty’s and other activity missions.

In addition, the whole concept of “unlocking” an icon when it’s discovered needs to end for open world games. Activity markers should only be present when the activity is active.

The process should be, the player has the option of starting in trade towns, talking to hint vendors to appear bounty, gang hide out, and other activity markers on the map. Once completing those activities the markers should disappear again.

If the game is going to be “open world” the map needs to feel new consistently. The linear process of unlocking locations on the map, filling it up with a bunch of dot icons is messy and completely destroys longevity concept.

the PC version sucks.....there are texture streaming issues and poor frustrate (though i did have it in 4k lol) apparently there are some fixes but eh.....after thinking about it and being so impressed with it on the xbox one s......i just got it refunded on steam....it just ""works"" on xbox one ( or ps3 i assume) so its better to just get it there.

decided to cancel the pc preorder and get it for xbox one anyways for rage 2. as there may be performance /other issues on the pc who knows i just rather have a smooth experence if i can.... so ther ya go!  no epic video as a result since on the console no way to hide the ui but who  knows maybe the second one will have a hide hud option and a way to hide your weapon lol.

Tim Willits has also said that a lot of missions will activate by just exploring the Wasteland! You will also run into people, and big ""hordes of vehicles"" by just walking/driving around! I think that there is quite a lot of reasons to Explore! Regarding loot. As we saw in one of the first gameplay videos. Walker cleared out a place that was infested with dudes from the Goon Squad, and when he was done, he was rewarded with money.

The Apex Engine has zero public documentation. None. Nada. AFAIK, tools like deca are made through manual reverse engineering. I found it through wanting to mod Rage 2. The game has epic modding potential, but its as if it was intentionally built to be technically unmoddable.

Honestly the thing I hate about Rage 2 is how theres so many unused locations and potential for new plot/missions outside the ""known world"", and (seemingly deliberately, it feels spiteful) no way to explore them or mod them. The glitch that worked at release no longer works, and there's no console or documented startup options. No noclip/fly commands. No way to disable the kill zones.

I don’t think you realize that consoles have CPU’s and GPU’s as well.

It’s not a bug, it was programmed intentionally. I’m positive that you aren’t familiar with programming or really how computers and consoles work so I think I’ll leave you to it.

You’re very obviously wrong here and no matter how many times you insist, you can’t back up anything you say.

My SO has a CS degree lol, I’m currently getting mine at GA Tech. You have to be *smart* to get a CS degree, and by the way you’re typing and what you’re saying shows complete ignorance.

I just hope that you learn something about how engines render in dynamic textures. I mean Google it ffs
