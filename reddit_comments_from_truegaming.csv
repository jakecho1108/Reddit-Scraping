Rage,1kqzr6b,Will we ever get a Rage 2 sequel?,mt9l6i3,"RAGE 2 failed to sell, so unlikely.

The main problem I found is it has too large open world, not enough content for it. The story even has a moment where you have to grind the open world activities in order to progress, which is just a desperate attempt to keep the players engaged. I mean, it has large open world, grind section, your weapons and armor scattered across that large open world and with all of that the second game is still about the same play time as the first one (~15 hours) that has none of that.

My biggest problem with Rage 1 is the final act. The Eastern Wasteland is like the final 3rd of the game when getting there should've been the halfway point.  Having more missions/characters and a better ending. Also, they repeat some characters like the five finger fillet guy and the guy who challenges you to a race for a car. The actual Wasteland should've had more things going on. It's very empty in both areas.
Rage 2 is like Doom 2016 on steroids. My biggest problem with it is you have to go all over the map to find all the guns. They should've been given to you through regular progression and possibly limited the play area in the beginning instead of being able to go anywhere. Have Ark areas to get more powers/upgrades.

RAGE 2 is a mash up between id and Avalanche and runs on the same engine as Max.  It is the spiritual successor.  FPS with dark side magic (only for attack, never for defense!). Tim Willits (Quake) directed the level design.  Lots of cars and a few bikes, ~30.  Most players stick to the main one but they are all viable to f* around in.

The first three hours are a little rough around the edges but you can change the difficulty at any time without penalty.  As you progress, it helps to progressively turn it up so more enemies spawn and you can keep your kill streaks going.


It is a sandbox adventure.  There is no RPG BS.   Everyone ends up with the same “build” and gear.

Rage,1igezkw,Rage 2,mcwd3fv,It fires 5 round bursts.  You can dump the clip in 2 seconds.  And the ammo is common.,True,2,t1_mcvvx9n
Rage,1igezkw,Rage 2,mcwt1v3,"The weapons and powers are similar to RAGE 2.  They take a few liberties; you have slow motion aim, a temporary force field, dash (more like “hustle”) and a flash bang-like attack.  The game takes place between movies 2 & 3 so there is no stupid shit like flying around with a jet pack and rocket launcher arm.  You are glued to the floor but have superhuman strength.  You can do things like pick up a trash dumpster, carry it as a shield, then throw it.  You can grab and throw enemies at each other, or up in the air and shoot them like clay pigeons.   Or shoot a guy off his motorcycle then throw his bike at the next one.


The secondary weapons are normal machine guns, shotguns etc.  There are some grenade launchers and Cobra Cannons but they are rare.  No plasma rifles!  Only Robo’s gun is sci-fi and the weapon you’ll use 95% of the time unless you want to screw around.  There are thirteen different “boards” you can equip and tinker with, which give the gun different effects.  Nothing too crazy;  i.e. it doesn’t turn into a grenade launcher or laser gun.


It is gory.  You can shoot ‘em in the dick then blow off a hand, “jerk that, creep.”  Pretty sure you can take whole arms and legs.  You can mutilate corpses on Xbox, probably PC but I hear not on PS5.  They won’t dismember after death but you can fill them full of bloody holes while they rag doll around.


Fair warning, there is a story and a lot of dialogue-tree cut scenes between stages.  I choose to be a complete asshole to everyone.  It does not affect combat but affects future dialogues and some subtle cosmetics in the game world.  The combat is brutal but the game has humor too.


It is not open world.   There are large maps to explore which contain multiple missions but they are hubs.  Once you do what you want / need to and exit the area, there is no going back.  Also, there is no driving.


It is excellent fan service and looks fantastic on UE5.",True,2,t1_mcvw1su

You can turn down the difficulty without penalty but once you get going, you need to crank it up.  You want more enemies to spawn to keep up your kill chains.  Easy and Normal will get you nowhere.


Max out your Sidewinder first.  It is absolutely brutal at level five but only at level five.  Better than RoboCop’s gun.


Abuse Overdrive every chance you get.  You never need to “save” it for a boss or anything.  The boss fights are mostly “shoot the weak point.”  Crank that OD up and use it and you will level up fast.  There will always be more.  It is gamified but the multiplier is how you gain surplus Feltrite.


Get like 120 health then max out your OD with the Cyber Doc.  OD is much more valuable than the Damage Augmentation perk.  I can keep my chain going and clear an entire location on a single charge.


All the DLC is worth it.  Get the deluxe editions.  Skip the $20 gun skin pack.  I was obsessed and bought it but always go back to the in-game skins.  Be mindful if you use cheat codes.  You need to make a hard save to revert back to or you will block all Achievements.

GO to C drive, find users->""wuteva ur name is""->saved games->id games->rage 2

there should be a file called setting, it is a txt file. Go through the file, search for vsync and change the value to 2. 

I have read somewhere that turning on vsync crashes the game somehow...and i turned it on for that hours i played because it quite improved the framerate stuttering issue...

i did try this but i set it to 0 first cuz i assumed its the value for ""off"". But no, u need to change it to 2 and that is the value for ""soft"". This was the default option for me when i first opened the game.

Stick with it.  The first three hours is frustrating because you’re underpowered (you can change the difficulty without penalty) but once you get the shotgun and some magic it’s easy.


Max out your Sidewinder ASAP and abuse Overdrive every chance you get.  The multiplier determines how much Feltrite enemies drop.  You will level up quickly.


You can “dual weald” any gun with wingsticks or grenades.  You shoot one-handed from the hip and get some cool animations.


All the cars are useful.  You don’t need guns.  The side ram is deadly at a mere 5 MPH against vehicles and especially good for roadside pedestrians.  I have taken down entire convoys with the ram.  (Ram the gas tanks on the leader.)


Cars have different tires.  Monster Truck in the swamp, buggy in the dunes, etc.   The Armadillo can go anywhere, up the face of a mountain.


Stick to the roads - you go faster on pavement and will learn your way around.  It is faster to use the road than go off-road.


Do not use the Icarus much.  It is kind of a cheat and unveils too much of the map too fast just from flying around.  It spoils the game.  The game is designed for you to roll up to new locations at ground level.  Call in a Chascar and drive it on the road; it is as fast as Icarus.

I feel like I am playing a totally different game than what these reviewers were given. Or, perhaps, I simply don't understand what makes up a non-boring, non-lifeless open world. I'd really like to see what they think that is.

Rage,bo2so7,RAGE 2 Review Megathread,ench54n,"It's the open world aspect that changes it. I posted this elsewhere, but a linear shooter has a massive advantage where the gameplay loop of ""Go here, kill bad guys, kill boss"" is engaging enough because level design is so important. That's why these games live and die by well designed levels. The story doesnt matter because getting from point A to point B is fun and entertaining. That simple gameplay loop is engaging because the level was designed with that in mind. Nothing else is needed.

Now make that open world. Instead of a deliberately crafted level that engages us while we are ""going here, killing bad guys, and killing a boss"" we have world design as the focus. Suddenly, we have to craft the entire map and world that is used for the game. A gameplay loop of shooting shit becomes less engaging as it stops becoming the focus. That's the trade off with these games, and why a story is important in open world games. If it was a linear FPS game I wouldn't worry about the story, but if we get dropped into this giant world with a bunch of NPCs and characters and settlements, but no lore and story, just the same gameplay loop, it will quickly turn into a chore.

Idk, I'm on the fence but there are some very real concerns. If this is just a checklist game similar to the 2014 Assassins Creed games, ehhh.",True,2,t1_enc89dq

 I felt like there were too many upgrades and things you can get often making me feel overwhelmed and i didn't really like the bartering system. I didn't feel like i needed to worry about surviving which is what i liked about the first game because of how strong you can get. I did like the combat.

I always wanted rage 2 to take place shortly after the first game with the whole war with the authority and resistance thing, not 30 years later. Would have been nice to know what happened during all that time, then you find out Nicholas is dead I believe. I just think it would have made much more sense for 2 to pick up right after the first game since it ended on such a cliffhanger, but maybe there's an explanation I just don't know about.

I know people like 2 more since it's open world and has so much to see and do but i just wasn't compelled to see it all and do everything, I was excited at first then i just wanted to get it over with.

It also released on a piss poor state on PC.

The vehicle combat sucked (I think Mad Max did a way better job at it)

I've asked on the forum, steam forum, Twitter, I've submitted a bug report to Bethesda support.  All that done, and still NO IDEA if Bethesda is aware of the issue or not.  So I'll ask here.

It's been asked by others, but here goes again.

Overdrive, the main ability of the game.  It doesn't function whatsoever in my game, the meter doesn't start to build at all, it's locked out.  Is a fix coming?  Is the bug being looked at?

I've tried everything I can think of, reset control schemes, started new game and unlocked overdrive then loaded main save.

By the time I realised it should be already unlocked and it was a bug, I was so far in I just continued on, and I've now finished the main mission (credits rolled, etc).

I'd like to continue on in the endgame, but I'd also like the main game ability to work as well hehe :).

Starting a new game would not only be annoying having to do all the collecting over again, but the statistics are global and not save specific, so I'd rather not start fresh and already have my stats showing a bunch of things I haven't done yet (3k+ kills, miles driven, deaths, etc).

Please Bethesda, pick a place to respond to your players, and start responding.  Customer support means actually SUPPORTING your customers, not ignoring them and then suddenly a surprise patch out of the blue.

I would just like to know if I should just hold tight and not play the game for a few days because a fix is coming, or should I just bite the bullet and go the nuclear option and start all over again :( (really don't like this option).

Ok so pc.

If you fail to read the junk lore that constantly pops up then by about 3/4 into the game you have quite a few exclamation marks !

I found the mission campaign completed ones won't clear at all so there's that but...when you try to clear the 50 or so other !... it will break the game every time.

Rught now I have about 50 unread junk pop ups and if I cycle through each one reading the Intel...after about 30 it will crash :(

The game will freeze and then I'll get some random overdrive screen and a blurry mess.  It's like it tries to go into the campaign mission from that pop up or who knows.

Can repeat each time so a bad glitch.

But you can do them a few at a time over a  hour or so it clears them.

Primary sounds are sent to the back and the background FX are pushed to the front. Due to this the primary FX such as weapon sounds are muffled and the VO lack any sort of bass, feel trebled and sometimes headache inducing to how high the pitch is. While on the other hand the ""squishy FX"" sounds such as the neck snapping scene in the first 5 minutes of the game are high and crisp. Also if you noticed the intro sequence after the logos have the music play as loud as possible while the FX feel like you're punching a pillow. I've tried using dual channel Yamaha Amplifier, 3.5mm Phone headsets, gaming headsets, and normal dual channel stereo desktop speakers... NONE OF THEM work properly with this game. Once I switched to a moderately modern 5.1 speaker setup, which I ONLY use for Studio one guitar FX, the audio seemed to equalize properly.

Completing ChazCar on easy was a nightmare because the camera kept locking on and tracking other cars like aim-assist was still turned on, the car would randomly stop turning even at mid or low speed (not sliding, not boosting, not in a jump), even the tiniest bump can cause the car to spin a 180, and the teleport-to-track would kick in at weird times. One time I rolled over the wall near the finish line and drove around the hillside for a couple minutes and I didn't finally get teleported back to the track until I had already driven to a different part of the course! Several times I've also been teleported when I was still very much on the track!

Also, movement and ADS are pretty disappointing. I've resorted to cutting the look sensitivity to 25 (from default 35) and relying on the ADS aim assist to pull the crosshairs onto the target.

Rage,bpdau6,RAGE 2 - PC Hotfix (5.16.19),i6pl6op,"ok, so this post was from three years ago, so how about this, I am trying to record in OBS, first problem I encountered is that although OBS is picking up the audio it is not present during playback, I know you are going to tell me something like ""that's something to discuss with OBS"" trying to pass off the issue, and matybe you're right however...  


while trying to fix the issue I encountered another problem, If I try to switch my output device to my audio interface, nothing plays, now the game just seems to not know what to do, sometimes there will be no sound whatsoever, other times it will simply continue to play through the computers soundcard (or more precisely the monitors)  


I have been trying to set myself up for recording/streaming for over a year now, I have had some success in recording Dark Souls remastered, I have recorded video and sound in ""A Plagues tale but found my mic audio to be way too low in the second video despite not changing any settings, but Rage 2... well Rage 2 just doesn't want to co-operate in any way shape or form whatsoever.  


As I mentioned it either gives me ZERO audio, or takes over my video monitors soundcard and refuses to play through anything else.  


YES, I have selected my interface as the default device, YES I have switched back (this is most often when it decides to give me nothing at all) and YES, I've gone over the internet trying to find and implement any fix I can find however nothing, upon NOTHING related to this specific issue, It's all related to whatever issues it had in the first place. which I guess is what this reddit is asking about.  


I see no option in the game menus to select an audio device and have NEVER seen ANY game do this previously, WHY CAN I NOT SELECT WHICH AUDIO DEVICE TO LISTEN THROUGH??? I do not want the sound to play through the video monitor as...  


1. the built in speakers suck major ass and...  

2. this would mean my mic would pick up game audio as well as my voice making it impossible to edit my voice separately from the damned game.

I'm not being a ""white knight"" or whatever silly outdated buzzword you want to use; I'm giving credit where it's due.

And again, for the third time on this thread I will make this point: LESS THAN 20% OF GAMES THAT USED DENUVO ON STEAM HAVE SINCE REMOVED THE DRM. REMOVING DENUVO IS NOT COMMON PRACTICE. IT IS ***RARE***.

Additionally, the majority of the more than 100 games that continue to use Denuvo on steam have also been cracked. Bethesda could have also followed that overwhelmingly common trend and easily left Denuvo intact, regardless of Rage 2 being pirated.  In fact, It would have been easier for Bethesda to do nothing and simply leave Denuvo in the game.

But, they did do something and have publicly said the reason they removed it was because of community backlash. We have no hard evidence outside of wild theories to believe otherwise.

But since you clearly have an irrational hate boner for game publishers - which you're inexplicably taking out on me - you're going to believe whatever reinforces your preconceived idea.

Rage 2 has open world elements similar to Farcry 4/5 and Saints Row, but it was built using an early version of DOOM Eternal's engine.

It did have a memory limit with MT mip levels and at what distance mips would be drawn at, and the big one, disc space, that's why you had a lot of blurry stuff in Rage and the terrain looked blurry in QW because of the compression(artists hated it because they'd spend all this time making a really good looking seen, then compressed the crap out of it). But, generally a lot cheaper than using traditional textures. But the cost/time efficiency of using MT's especially at a AAA level is just not feasible anymore unfortunately.

Max out your Sidewinder immediately and use Overdrive every chance you get.  Never save OD; there will be more, and the multiplier is how you earn more feltrite.  You level up fast if you spam OD.  Once you get the first healing perk you are good to go.  The game is too easy.  It plays better on hard and very hard because it  spawns enough enemies to keep your multiplier and health up.  Fight hard until you have to defib, then be careful.  If you are not looking at your defib recharge, the difficulty is too low.

Keep playing.   The development is uneven.   The first few hours are an awkward tech demo, then it finds its gait.  The female voice actor is better and helps cut through the BS dialogue.


Max out your Sidewinder immediately.  It is brutal on level 5, and only on level 5.   Bullets become valuable.  Forget upgrading the rifle and shotgun; they can wait a bit, trust me.


Use Overdrive every chance you get - the multiplier determines how much feltrite drops.  Turn up the difficulty to hard or very hard so the game spawns more enemies.  You will level up much faster.  Do not be ashamed to defib regularly - it is a weapon and part of the combat loop.  Fight hard until you hit the ground, then play it safe.

Back in 2019, there was a lot of hopes for a Rage 3 ^^ 


"" That kind of a reaction is apparently enough for id Software to want to turn the Rage series into a full-blown trilogy. Despite the fact that Rage 2 has just barely hit store shelves, the developer is incredibly eager to get raging all over again.

This urge for more Rage comes directly from id Software Studio Director Tim Willits. During an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Willits declared that the company adored the world they had created and wanted to dive right back in. He stated that “it’s a crazy, fun, exciting franchise and I hope we can make a third one as soon as possible.”  ""

The first game was laughingly short and could be beaten in less than 5 hours on the hardest difficulty if you knew what you were doing. But where Rage 1 was strong at was portraying a post apocalyptic world with the illusion of going through a decayed city in one of the missions.

However in Rage 2, the creative atompshere is just lacking.

The guy muttered “Shit, this sucks!” then let out a roaring “Fuck!!!” as he jumped over the barricade and charged me.


The fact that I can recall it means it left an impression.


And yes, the NPCs…Loosum (she’s 18, right?) and Jani are super cute.  It’s the only video game I’ve ever crushed on.  And Sarah(?) in Scorchers… Gratuitously sexy, yet effective.  The art rocks.  It was my favorite 360 game, even though it’s clearly unfinished.


It’s basically a tech demo for idTech 5, which was used for Wolfenstein. 


RAGE 2 was a huge sleeper hit (for me, anyway) with terrible marketing and a bad launch (those reviews last forever.). I liked the first one so much, I finally decided to buy a cheap copy of 2 off eBay, thinking it would be something fun for a weekend or two - they said it’s 8-12 hours long.  I did all ~100 missions three times and spent 300 hours in actual combat The timer stops in the menus, so probably double that.  Maybe 1000.


I played on One-S first, the “weakest” port of the game, and it ran like a dream; no loads, that was a big deal; you could get lost for hours.  A fat sack of mushrooms doesn’t hurt either.


I always played as the female.  Her dry sarcastic voice acting helps temper the “goofiness.”  I’m also an old, drunken, stoned pervert and found the tone of the game to be perfect.  The devs had a lot of loose fun with it.


Again, it’s clearly unfinished.  I believe there was supposed to be a final act in those mountains to the NW of the map, against the Authority.  The terrain appears to be finished; not wallpaper, and I’ve encountered some Authority enemy models in random roadside encounter which do not appear in any missions.

If you want to search more / make hard, play without double jump.  There is always a ladder or something you can mantle.   You can clear the game with your starting load out.


Don’t fast travel or use the Icarus too much.  It resets random encounters.  Drive and stay on the roads.  Don’t boost too much.  Chascar is as fast as Icarus.  Side ram is lethal in all vehicles at just 5 MPH and great against convoys and pedestrians.  You don’t need guns.  Play around with the cars like GTA.  It’s fun.  They have different tire types too.  Monster in the swamp, buggy in the dunes, etc.  Dying in any vehicle is rare unless you drive off a cliff.


Max out your Sidewinder if you haven’t already.  It is ferocious at level 5 and bullets become valuable.  You can fire it from motorcycles.


Use Overdrive every chance you get.  Enemies drop feltrite based on the multiplier.  Use OD infusions in combat instead of health infusions - they heal you instantly.

I've been a huge fan of Bethesda and Id for a LONG time. Bethesda is the only publisher I've ever even preordered a game from. I really enjoyed Rage 1 and was excited when they announced Rage 2 (never thought it would happen). After FO76, I decided I wasn't going to preorder anything again and anymore I don't trust anyone enough to buy any other games at launch. I totally get that in this day and age game companies need to find ways to get more than the $60.00 price tag new games have had for far too long but this is not the way to do it. 

&#x200B;

Honestly, dumb little things like this are more likely to make me wait until a game goes on sale or drops in price before I pick it up. Too many games get released these days that are obviously not complete, full of bugs, and unpolished. Odds are pretty high that if I wait a year+ to pick this (or ANY other AAA game) up I'll have a much better/complete experience than I would day 1 for a fraction of the price. The only draw back to this is, the amount of future support a game gets (or the possibility of getting another game in the series) is based off of its sales around release.",True,1,t1_emrqrje

Mutant Monster Truck Skin – Run over enemies in style with this exclusive vehicle skin. The truck is self-cleaning, so don’t worry about those pesky blood stains messing up the pearl coating.
Wasteland Wizard Cheat Codes – You’ve been granted mighty new powers by the reclusive wasteland wizard! Utilize this collection of exclusive “cheat codes” to rule the wasteland.
Progress Booster – Kick into Overdrive! Get more bang for your bang with this wasteland Progress Booster.
Nicholas Raine Armor and Settler Pistol – Slip into Raine’s legendary Arkist armor and relive the classics with his powerful Settler Pistol.
Battle Standard – Strike fear into the hearts of your enemies as you race into combat with this imposing banner streaming from your vehicle.

It's not $20 bucks extra for a gun. It's $20 bucks for the gun and a bunch of other stuff for preordering.  You can't just focus on the one thing you want and label it as that single item promoting the increase in cost for the entire product.  I get what you're saying, that that's obtuse and a linear way of thinking.

Also, I don't believe people are trying to directly compare CDPR with Bethesda here. They are comparing the way they are promoting the game and saying that CDPR has done the same type of promotion method.  No they are no where near the same, but it is a similar marketing model.",True,8,t1_en0lrf9

Rage,1f7k8u7,RAGE as a role-playing game,lmnw5ly,"Hmmm... I feel like I've seen skill-less tabletop RPGs though. I don't think it's a skill system itself that would make an RPG but rather it would need some type of semi-(because roguelikes are grouped into RPGs)persistent progression system. A skill system is a form of a progression system. And with optional progression, comes choice, which I think is ultimately what is inherent in RPG systems.  
  
With the definition I've landed on over the last few days, RAGE would be an RPG simply because of the upgrades you can buy both for yourself and your car. What are skills if not upgrades, and what are skill points if not currency?   
  
In the same vain BioShock would also fall in there. I don't think there is an ImmSim that isn't on some level an RPG. Versus with something like Halo, you don't have any persistent progression. So I wouldn't count that. 

I think there's certainly a spectrum. One game might be more of an RPG than another. I think that comes down to the quantity of systems which provide a player choice. When most people think of RPGs nowadays it seems like it's usually (1) statistical progression, (2) skill trees, (3) equipment progression, and (4) narrative choices. I think the difference of definition comes down to what an individual player sees as the delineating cut-off point within that spectrum. If you asked someone from the 80's, #4 wouldn't seem necessary. Someone else might have a more conservative definition, such as there must be narrative choice as well as each choice must lead to meaningfully different outcomes.   
  
I've come to learn that I'm exceedingly liberal in my definition. If there's any persistent choice, it feels like an RPG to me. (Roguelikes have never felt like RPGs to me because they lack that persistence, though roguelites would get a pass here.) At the same time, I don't think I should be defining what an RPG is to other people. These are all just descriptive categories after all, and there generally is a ""if it quacks like a duck, it's a duck"" consensus, so it's not like the ambiguity of the genre is hurting the community. Leaving it ambiguous leaves room for that individual choice, which I find rather poetic.",True,1,t1_lml86xd

I'm not blaming you personally; I just get frustrated as fuck that these falsehoods have started to become so deeply ingrained as to become a cancer. 

Rage is an action/adventure FPS game. It has no RPG elements, because it is 100% equipment-based. Rage 2 is the same. All character upgrades come from equipment, not experience. A lot of people confuse story-driven with RPG. Any game can be story driven, even crappy puzzle games, but an RPG has elements that no other game type has. Yes, RPGs always have the search for better gear, but the gear itself does NOT determine your character's base power and abilities. The only Zelda game that had actual RPG elements was Zelda II, because you gained XPs which made you harder to hurt, spells used less magic, and have stronger attacks. It was very minimal an RPG, though, as you still had to collect hearts and stuff to raise your core HP and MP. True RPGs don't do that. The Final Fantasy Legend series on the GB were not RPGs. All skill and stat boosts were 100% based on buying gear.",True,4,t1_lmpn5k3
